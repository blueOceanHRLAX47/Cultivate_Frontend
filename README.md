### Front end diagrams
+ TODO: Ask Nick to make some diagrams for how the front end works or some screenshots explaining the flow of the app

### Back end and cloud diagrams
+ TODO: Put in the diagrams to a folder and explain them here

## Development Challenges
+ Developing the front end had some extra challenges since the backend was over architected and hard to run on local machines
+ Switching to a mobile first css layout is hard when css was not originally designed for it
+ Google Cloud Platform makes you jump through some hoops to enforce security
