      title: "Teriyaki Chicken with Yoshida's sauce",
      content: "I was at the grocery yesterday and Yoshida's looks promising. I like teriyaki but have basically gave up on trying to make it but it has been awhile. Gordon Ramsey's recipe looks spot on if I were to give it a go. It has the oriental essentials, garlic, ginger, and green onion. My friends that have restaurants have told me their hacks and almost all do a slight doctor or mix of store bought. When I think of teriyaki wings I envision a mix of teriyaki and sweet and sour or maybe a shot of ketchup but not straight.",
